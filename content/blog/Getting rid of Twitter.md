I have decided to get rid of my twitter account. It is a place where people go to be unproductive and angry. I don't like feeling unproductive, I don't like feeling angry.

If people from that account would like to keep in touch with me they are free to communicate with me so I can send them my discord account. Or simply communicate via email.

That being said my [artwork account](https://twitter.com/drawingsvin) will stay up.

Here's some general links:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/svinny24/) - I don't really post much here besides SFW artwork. Connected to IRL people around me.
* [Twitter(Art account)](twitter.com/drawingsvin) - Only used to post artwork(+NSFW)
* [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/41125292/artworks) - Artwork but on Pixiv(Those with an account can download high res images).
